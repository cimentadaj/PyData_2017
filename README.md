# PyData 2017

On the 19th of May 2017 I gave a workshop at [PyData Barcelona](https://pydata.org/barcelona2017/) on the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/).

This workshop is a summary of a more detailed introduction to the `tidyverse` which can be found [here](https://github.com/cimentadaj/tidyverse_seminars/). This repo contains the slides for the presentation.
